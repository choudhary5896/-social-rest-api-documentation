# social-rest-api-documentation
i have wrapup all the apis in the documentation so that it would be easy for frontend developer to understand the endpoints better and can make a call to backend 
and can get desire result .
in this i have covered all the things like which error will given by any particular endpoints 
if you make bad request.
it give response with their status code like 400 is for user error and 500 for server error .
so it helps to front end developer to  debug errors
